# My_Call_Apps

In this repository, I have sliced the UI into 5 pages within the allocated 1-hour time frame. There are some tasks I would like to implement, 
such as making calls using the built-in WebRTC plugin in Flutter, before the assessment reaches the UI slicing and code quality. However, 
I believe the evaluation will only cover UI slicing and code quality.

Moving forward, I would like to mention that I am already familiar with using Twilio, Agora, Firebase, and Sendbird for telephone and chat 
service plugins. Additionally, I am accustomed to working with Git and Bitbucket. I am also well-versed in collaborating within large teams.

Thank You
